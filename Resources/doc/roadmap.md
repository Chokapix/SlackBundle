# Roadmap

To view a bit into the future there are some ideas for features and the will to implement them. The long term Target is to create a Set of Project-Management Features to make the daily work easier and use the full capacity of the gorgeous Slack-System.

* Upload Files
* Connectors for extern Tools to fetch Data and post them (maybe with a cache to only get updated content)
* "iDoneThis" for Slack-Chat (Checking if it is possible with the API)


The following Features could not be implemented yet because of problems with the API of Slack.

* Update ChatMessage for ProgressBars etc.
