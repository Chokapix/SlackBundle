# Roadmap

There are a bunch of Features to be done before the first stable Version will be released.

* Auth-Test to the DebugCommand
* Catching the [Rate Limits](https://api.slack.com/docs/rate-limits) of the API and try again for a bunch of tries
* Write Topic of a Channel
* Update ChatMessage for ProgressBars etc.
* Upload File for automatic Reportings

To view a bit into the future there are some ideas for features and the will to implement them. The long term Target is to create a Set of Project-Management Features to make the daily work easier and use the full capacity of the gorgeous Slack-System.

* Reading E-Mails from an Account (maybe olny for slack-client)
* Sending E-Mails for daily reports of team members in an channel and post the awnsers
* Connectors for extern Tools to fetch Data and post them (maybe with a cache to only get updated content)
