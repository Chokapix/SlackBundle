# Roadmap

To view a bit into the future there are some ideas for features and the will to implement them. The long term Target is to create a Set of Project-Management Features to make the daily work easier and use the full capacity of the gorgeous Slack-System.

* Update ChatMessage for ProgressBars etc.
* Upload File for automatic Reportings
* Reading E-Mails from an Account (maybe olny for slack-client)
* Sending E-Mails for daily reports of team members in an channel and post the awnsers
* Connectors for extern Tools to fetch Data and post them (maybe with a cache to only get updated content)
